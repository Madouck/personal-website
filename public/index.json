This is a gentle introduction to the tidymodels package (which, like the tidyverse, is actually a collection of packages), and in order to examine various functions and capabilities of those packages, we'll build two very simple models, using easily available NHL data, and go over a few ways to evaluate them.\nThe tidymodels package, which is fairly new, was designed to make it easier to create your model framework in a tidy way and consists of, among others, recipes (prepping models), parsnip (executing models), and yardstick (evaluating models). Here, we'll build two simple models to predict whether an NHL player is a forward or a defenseman.\nFind and prepare the data First, let's get our data prepped—we're using 2018-19 data so we can have a full season. We'll get the position data by downloading from Natural Stat Trick, and we'll create our statistics from the raw play-by-play data, available via the Evolving Wild scraper. (Could you download all these summary statistics from NST instead? Definitely. But this is about learning, and it's great R practice [pRactice?] to generate them yourself from the play-by-play data.)\n One of the tidymodels packages called dials has a margin() function that will mask the margin() function in ggplot2. If you use the margin() function in your ggplot2 custom theme like I do, just load tidymodels before tidyverse and you should be fine.   library(tidymodels) library(tidyverse) # Read in files (pbp from Evolving Hockey, bios from Natural Stat Trick) pbp \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026#34;pbp_20182019_all.csv\u0026#34;) bios \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026#34;bios_1819.csv\u0026#34;) # Find player TOI and games played # To do so, you must pivot the data so there is one row per player # (instead of one row per event) # We don\u0026#39;t care about the ice time for the goalies (sorry, goalies) # so they will be filtered out # We also do some name changes to make things easier later player_TOI \u0026lt;- pbp %\u0026gt;% filter(event_length \u0026gt;

19) These stats are the ones that we're going to use in our model to predict whether a given player is a forward or a defenseman. Let's create at a few graphs, just to see how some of these data look.\n# The code for these four graphs is nearly the same, just change the x # and the title/labels final_data %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x = weight, fill = defense)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.7, color = NA) + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\u0026#34;#0d324d\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;#a188a6\u0026#34;)) + labs( y = \u0026#34;Density\u0026#34;, x = \u0026#34;Weight (lbs)\u0026#34;, fill = NULL, title = \u0026#34;Weight by Position\u0026#34;, subtitle = \u0026#34;2018-19 NHL Season, 20+ Games Played Only\u0026#34;, caption = \u0026#34;Source: Natural Stat Trick\u0026#34; ) + meg_theme() + theme(legend.position = c(0.9, 0.9))             We can spot some differences here by position: defensemen tend to score at a lower rate and block shots at a higher rate than forwards do. They also tend to spend more time on the ice (by necessity, since there are generally half the number of defensemen as forwards on a dressed roster), which is one of the most well-known differences in the positions. In order to try to predict whether a given player is a forward or a defenseman, we're going to build two logistic regression models. One will have the average time on ice as its sole predictor variable, while the other will have all of these variables (average time on ice, height, weight, points per 60, shots per 60, unblocked shots per 60, hits per 60, hits received per 60, and blocked shots per 60) as predictor variables.\nGet data ready for modeling Our final_data data frame from above will be the base of our model_data (we're just removing two unnecessary variables), and we'll use set.seed() to create reproducible samples.\n# Rearrange our model data model_data \u0026lt;- final_data %\u0026gt;% select(player, defense, everything(), -c(games, TOI)) # Set the seed (very useful for reproducible samples!) set.seed(1234) # Split into training and testing data split_data \u0026lt;- initial_split(model_data, prop = 0.6, strata = defense) The last line of code above, which created a list called split_data, uses the helpful initial_split function from the rsample package. This allows us to create a training data set and a testing data set, an essential step when modeling. We will train the data on one data set and then test the models on a separate data set. You can set the proportion on your own, of how many observations will go to the training data, but it will default to 0.75 without a different specification. And why did I include defense as an optional strata argument?\n   As you can see above, our data set has nearly twice the amount of forwards as defensemen. By using the strata option, we can ensure that there's a similar proportion of forwards to defensemen in both our training and our testing data sets.\n# Create our testing and training data sets training_data \u0026lt;- training(split_data) testing_data \u0026lt;- testing(split_data) # Write the recipe for our small TOI_only model recipe_TOI_only \u0026lt;- training_data %\u0026gt;% recipe(defense ~ TOI_game) %\u0026gt;% step_center(all_predictors()) %\u0026gt;% step_scale(all_predictors()) %\u0026gt;% prep() recipe_TOI_only In the code above, we can create our basic training and test data sets and then move onto the useful functions of the recipes package. This package allows you to create a recipe in order to organize all of your processing steps for your model(s). You specify the arguments with the recipe() function and then specify processing steps with the various functions that begin with step_. There are dozens of these that will perform all sorts of functions (e.g., create dummy variables, input various values, take the log), but here we're just using step_center() and step_scale() to show you how to normalize variables. In order to specify variables for these step_ functions, you can use standard dplyr::select variables (e.g., starts_with(), ends_with()) or select by role (e.g., all_predictors(), all_outcomes()) or select by data type (e.g., all_numeric()). And you can of course select by variable name, as well.\nWe now have a recipe called recipe_TOI_only that looks like this.\n   Run our models # Extract our prepped training data  # and \u0026#34;bake\u0026#34; our testing data training_baked_TOI \u0026lt;- juice(recipe_TOI_only) testing_baked_TOI \u0026lt;- recipe_TOI_only %\u0026gt;% bake(testing_data) # Run the model with our training data logistic_glm_TOI \u0026lt;- logistic_reg(mode = \u0026#34;classification\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;% set_engine(\u0026#34;glm\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;% fit(defense ~ ., data = training_baked_TOI) Now that we have our recipe, we can apply it to our training and testing data. Since the training data was the base of the recipe, we can use the juice() function to extract it. And the bake() function will prep the test data. Then, we can actually run the model with functions from the parsnip package. The package handles many different kind of models, but here we're running a simple logistic regression and training it on our baked data.\n# Find the class predictions from our testing data # And add back in the true values from testing data predictions_class_TOI \u0026lt;- logistic_glm_TOI %\u0026gt;% predict(new_data = testing_baked_TOI) %\u0026gt;% bind_cols(testing_baked_TOI %\u0026gt;% select(defense)) # Find the probability predictions # And add all together predictions_TOI \u0026lt;- logistic_glm_TOI %\u0026gt;% predict(testing_baked_TOI, type = \u0026#34;prob\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;% bind_cols(predictions_class_TOI) Now that the model has been trained, we can apply it to the testing data. The data frame we just created, predictions_TOI, looks like this. For each observation in our test data set, we have the predicted position and the probability that drove that prediction. We also brought in the defense variable from the test data set.\n   Just for fun, we can bring the player variable back from the original test data set and look at who was predicted the most incorrectly.\n# Look at who was predicted the most incorrectly # (Just for fun) most_wrong_TOI \u0026lt;- predictions_TOI %\u0026gt;% bind_cols(select(testing_data, player, TOI_game)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(incorrect = .pred_class != defense) %\u0026gt;% filter(incorrect == TRUE) %\u0026gt;% mutate(prob_actual = ifelse(defense == \u0026#34;D\u0026#34;, .pred_D, .pred_F)) %\u0026gt;% arrange(prob_actual)    As to be expected with such a simple model that's based solely on TOI, the predictions aren't so good for defensemen who don't play a lot of minutes or forwards who do. Let's move on to our kitchen sink model that includes all the variables.\n# Do the same process for our kitchen sink model recipe_kitchen_sink \u0026lt;- training_data %\u0026gt;% recipe(defense ~ weight + height + points_60 + shots_60 + fenwick_60 + hits_60 + hits_rec_60 + blocks_60 + TOI_game) %\u0026gt;% step_corr(all_predictors(), threshold = 0.8) %\u0026gt;% step_center(all_predictors()) %\u0026gt;% step_scale(all_predictors()) %\u0026gt;% prep() recipe_kitchen_sink training_baked_KS \u0026lt;- juice(recipe_kitchen_sink) testing_baked_KS \u0026lt;- recipe_kitchen_sink %\u0026gt;% bake(testing_data) # Run the model with our training data logistic_glm_KS \u0026lt;- logistic_reg(mode = \u0026#34;classification\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;% set_engine(\u0026#34;glm\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;% fit(defense ~ ., data = training_baked_KS) # Find the class predictions from our testing data # And add back in the true values from testing data predictions_class_KS \u0026lt;- logistic_glm_KS %\u0026gt;% predict(new_data = testing_baked_KS) %\u0026gt;% bind_cols(testing_baked_KS %\u0026gt;% select(defense)) # Find the probability predictions # And add all together predictions_KS \u0026lt;- logistic_glm_KS %\u0026gt;% predict(testing_baked_KS, type = \u0026#34;prob\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;% bind_cols(predictions_class_KS) The code above looks very similar to the code from before, except we added an extra step in our recipe. The step_corr() function will study all the correlations among variables you specify and remove offenders, as it often isn't a good idea to have variables in your model that are highly correlated with each other. The default threshold for exclusion is 0.9, but you can specify whatever value you want. As you can see in the recipe below, our recipe automatically removed the shots_60 variable, which is (obviously) very highly correlated to the unblocked shot attempt variable, fenwick_60.\n   Evaluate our models In this section, I'm only going to show the code for one model (though we're evaluating two), but of course you would use the same code for both. (And if you were working with multiple models that you want to compare, it'd be a good idea to create functions to do these steps so that you aren't copying and pasting.)\nFirst we can create a confusion matrix, which simply plots the predicted values against the actual values.\n# Create a confusion matrix predictions_TOI %\u0026gt;% conf_mat(defense, .pred_class) %\u0026gt;% pluck(1) %\u0026gt;% as_tibble() %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(Prediction, Truth, alpha = n)) + geom_tile(show.legend = FALSE) + geom_text(aes(label = n), colour = \u0026#34;white\u0026#34;, alpha = 1, size = 8) + meg_theme() + theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank()) + labs( y = \u0026#34;Actual Position\u0026#34;, x = \u0026#34;Predicted Position\u0026#34;, fill = NULL, title = \u0026#34;Confusion Matrix\u0026#34;, subtitle = \u0026#34;TOI Only Model\u0026#34; )       Just from a brief look at this, the kitchen sink model clearly has higher accuracy (calculated as the number of correct predictions divided by the number of total predictions) than the TOI only model.\n# Find the accuracy predictions_TOI %\u0026gt;% accuracy(defense, .pred_class) # Find the logloss predictions_TOI %\u0026gt;% mn_log_loss(defense, .pred_D) # Find the area under the ROC curve (AUC) predictions_TOI %\u0026gt;% roc_auc(defense, .pred_D) # Create a tibble that holds all the evaluation metrics TOI_metrics \u0026lt;- tibble( \u0026#34;log_loss\u0026#34; = mn_log_loss(predictions_TOI, defense, .pred_D) %\u0026gt;% select(.estimate), \u0026#34;accuracy\u0026#34; = accuracy(predictions_TOI, defense, .pred_class) %\u0026gt;% select(.estimate), \u0026#34;auc\u0026#34; = roc_auc(predictions_TOI, defense, .pred_D) %\u0026gt;% select(.estimate) ) %\u0026gt;% unnest(everything()) %\u0026gt;% pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = \u0026#34;metric\u0026#34;, values_to = \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;% mutate(model = \u0026#34;TOI_only\u0026#34;) The yardstick package is what holds a lot of these functions that are useful for model evaulation. We just defined accuracy, which you can calculate on your own from the confusion matrix and is also available via the accuracy() function. That's useful for determining how good the model is in a binary sense, while log loss (from the mn_log_loss() function) uses the probabilities to quantify how correct the predictions are. As an example, let's go back to our TOI only model and see that Aleksander Barkov (a forward) was given a 0.75 probability of being a defenseman. That's obviously incorrect. It's counted as an incorrect prediction for the accuracy metric, but log loss also takes into account that the prediction was quite wrong. If the prediction had instead given him a 0.51 probability of being a defenseman, the penalty would be less.\nWe can also create a tibble (a type of data frame) to hold all of these metrics. We'll use it to compare both models in a minute. The last metric included is the area under the ROC curve, known as AUC. The ROC curve graphs the false positive rate against the true positive rate and in a nutshell, quantifies how good the model is at distinguishing the groups.\nThe yardstick package also makes it really easy to graph the curve itself.\n# Look at the ROC curve predictions_TOI %\u0026gt;% roc_curve(defense, .pred_D) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x = 1 - specificity, y = sensitivity)) + geom_path() + geom_abline(lty = 3) + coord_equal() + meg_theme() + labs( y = \u0026#34;True Positive Rate (Sensitivity)\u0026#34;, x = \u0026#34;False Positive Rate\u0026#34;, fill = NULL, title = \u0026#34;ROC Curve\u0026#34;, subtitle = \u0026#34;TOI Only Model\u0026#34; )       The ideal ROC curve is one that goes high up into the top left corner (as to maximize the area underneath it), so again, it appears that our kitchen sink model is performing better here. Lastly, let's use the tibbles we created to hold the evaulation metrics and graph to compare.\nmetrics_compare \u0026lt;- TOI_metrics %\u0026gt;% bind_rows(KS_metrics) metrics_compare %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(fill = model, y = value, x = metric)) + geom_bar(position = \u0026#34;dodge\u0026#34;, stat = \u0026#34;identity\u0026#34;) + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\u0026#34;#7A8B99\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;#A9DDD6\u0026#34;)) + meg_theme() + labs( y = \u0026#34;Value\u0026#34;, x = \u0026#34;Metric\u0026#34;, fill = NULL, title = \u0026#34;Comparing Our Models\u0026#34;, subtitle = \u0026#34;Higher is Better: Accuracy and AUC\\nLower is Better: Log Loss\u0026#34; ) + geom_text(aes(label = round(value, 3)), vjust = -0.5, size = 3, position = position_dodge(width= 0.9)) + theme(legend.position = c(0.86, 0.9))    We saw previously from the confusion matrices that the accuracy for the kitchen sink model is higher, and this tells us that the AUC is higher, as well, while the log loss is lower (which is good). Thanks to the evaluation metrics of the yardstick package (and there are many more than the few we viewed!), we have evidence that compared to the TOI only model, the kitchen sink model makes more accurate predictions and is better at distinguishing between the groups.\ntidymodels is a pretty neat set of packages, and I hope this little tutorial was useful in introducing some of the many features.

The teams were chosen semi-randomly (to get a decent distribution of shot attempt rates, both for and against), and games were selected randomly to end up with about a quarter of all penalty kill minutes for that team during 2018-19. I tracked zone time (so that I could track how well a penalty kill was able to keep a power play out of its offensive zone and also calculate shot rates for offensive zone time only), as well as zone entries and exits.\n   Selected Teams     Chicago   Colorado   Dallas   Winnipeg   Vegas   Edmonton   Vancouver   New Jersey   NY Islanders   NY Rangers   Philadelphia   Florida    The bulk of the penalty kill data is available in the slides from my OTTHAC presentation and the data visualization that accompanied it.\nPower play data However, tracking penalty kills means I automatically have some data on power plays! I ended up with some data for all 31 teams, but here I have restricted the plots to the 11 teams for which I had the most data (60 to ~100 minutes). This isn't enough game time to make sweeping conclusions, but it's enough to look at a few graphs.\n   Selected Teams     Buffalo   Calgary   Colorado   Edmonton   Florida   Nashville   Ottawa   Philadelphia   St. Louis   Vancouver   Washington    Shown below is the percent of total power play time on ice that the power play spent in its offensive zone. I was surprised to see a relatively small spread in the percentages (besides Ottawa).\n   As I mentioned previously with the penalty kill data, having zone time makes it possible to calculate a per 60 shot rate (for unblocked shot attempts, in this case) that is based on offensive zone time only, instead of just total power play time on ice. This shows how frequently teams generate shots when they're actually in the zone.\n   It's interesting to contrast Ottawa and Colorado in these two graphs. Ottawa wasn't particularly successful at staying in the offensive zone, but when they were there, they generated a lot of unblocked shot attempts. Colorado was nearly the opposite, in that they spent a lot of time in the offensive zone but weren't as prolific with the shots. The \u0026quot;regular\u0026quot; unblocked shot attempt rates for the two teams over these games were nearly identical.\n   Lastly, since I tracked zone entry data, as well, we can look at how power play teams tended to enter their own zone by examining the percentage of all entries that were dump-ins versus carries and passes. In this smallish sample there was a wide variation between teams that tended to dump the puck in more (Nashville, Calgary) and teams that ver rarely did (Colorado, Ottawa).\n","date":1582502400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582502400,"objectID":"def377eb53bb076039b4aa5ee5ea1b0b","permalink":"/post/pk_project/","publishdate":"2020-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/pk_project/","section":"post","summary":"Last year, I tracked 1146 minutes of penalty kills, spread across 12 teams from the 2018-19 season.

Micah Blake McCurdy developed an adjustment method for 5v5 events that is currently used to create the score- and venue-adjusted shot attempt metrics available at hockey stats websites like Natural Stat Trick and Evolving Hockey.\nSince I spend a lot of time looking at special teams data, I have long been curious as to whether score effects might also be a factor for power plays. Here, I've modified Micah's method to investigate score effects at 5v4: I created the weights, compared them to the 5v5 weights, and examined the repeatability and predictivity of the adjusted values compared to the raw ones. Investigating this problem taught me a lot of new R skills, so I've included all code and will go through the process step-by-step. (So if you're only interested in the conclusion, just scroll past the code and look at the graphs!)\nGet and prepare the data To start, I used the play-by-play query tool available at Evolving Hockey to collect all power play events from the past 10 seasons. (This was much quicker than scraping full seasons of data, and if you'd like access to the tool, support them on Patreon.) With all of the files in the same folder, instead of reading them in one-by-one, some functions from the plyr package make it easier to read them all in and combine them into one file.\nlibrary(plyr) library(readr) library(tidyverse) library(infer) # All 10 of my csv files (one for each season) are in a folder in my wd called \u0026#34;score_adj\u0026#34; # This will ID all the files and read them in as one file (score_adj_5v4_raw) mydir = \u0026#34;score_adj\u0026#34; myfiles = list.files(path=mydir, pattern=\u0026#34;*.csv\u0026#34;, full.names=TRUE) myfiles score_adj_5v4_raw = ldply(myfiles, read_csv) I filtered down to only the events that I want (all unblocked shot attempts as well as any events with time, so I can create rates) and created some new variables. Per Micah's method, all leads over 2 and below -2 were grouped.\n# We\u0026#39;ll filter down to only unblocked shot attempts and time events (to get fenwick \u0026amp; rates) # And also create variables to get the home lead and an indicator whether the event is home or away # For home lead, everything above 2 and below -2 will be grouped together score_adj_5v4 \u0026lt;- score_adj_5v4_raw %\u0026gt;% filter(event_type %in% c(\u0026#34;SHOT\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;GOAL\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;MISS\u0026#34;) | event_length \u0026gt; 0) %\u0026gt;% mutate(home_lead = home_score - away_score, home_lead = ifelse(home_lead \u0026lt;= -3, -3, ifelse(home_lead \u0026gt;= 3, 3, home_lead)), home_away = ifelse(event_team == home_team, \u0026#34;home\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;away\u0026#34;), fenwick = ifelse(event_type %in% c(\u0026#34;SHOT\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;GOAL\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;MISS\u0026#34;), 1, 0), goal = ifelse(event_type == \u0026#34;GOAL\u0026#34;, 1, 0), PP_team = ifelse(game_strength_state == \u0026#34;5v4\u0026#34;, home_team, away_team), type = ifelse(fenwick == 1 \u0026amp; PP_team == event_team, \u0026#34;PP\u0026#34;, ifelse(fenwick == 1, \u0026#34;PK\u0026#34;, NA)), PP_fenwick = ifelse(type == \u0026#34;PP\u0026#34; \u0026amp; fenwick == 1, 1, 0), f = ifelse(PP_fenwick == 1, \u0026#34;Y\u0026#34;, NA)) %\u0026gt;% select(type, PP_fenwick, f, game_strength_state, home_team, away_team, PP_team, event_team, everything())  Create the weights The first step is to determine what the weights should be. In our raw data, all unblocked shot attempts count the same: as one. But they are not all truly equal since we know that trailing teams generate more shot attempts. If the team that is currently winning by two goals generates a shot attempt, for example, that should count as more than one shot attempt because it's more difficult. And vice versa for the team that is currently losing. We can calculate how much these shot attempts should be boosted or penalized by comparing the actual values to the average values (i.e., if there was no difference).\nThe first data frame below, score_adj_f, just sums the unblocked shot attempts for each state to give us the raw values. (You'll see that the lockout-shortened season is filtered out, we'll discuss why later.) The second data frame score_adj_f_avg sums unblocked shot attempts for each score state only. Those average values get joined back into the first data frame, and then we can create a weight by dividing the true value by the average. score_adj_f_reshape just uses the pivot_wider function to reshape the values to make them more readable.\n# We filter by power play fenwick events only, then # group by home_away and home_lead score_adj_f \u0026lt;- score_adj_5v4 %\u0026gt;% filter(PP_fenwick == 1) %\u0026gt;% filter(season != 20122013) %\u0026gt;% group_by(home_lead, home_away, f) %\u0026gt;% summarize(fenwick = sum(PP_fenwick)) # Group by home_lead to get the average fenwicks score_adj_f_avg \u0026lt;- score_adj_f %\u0026gt;% group_by(home_lead) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg = mean(fenwick)) # Join the average back into the previous data frame # and create the adjusted score by dividing the average by the raw fenwick score_adj_f \u0026lt;- score_adj_f %\u0026gt;% left_join(score_adj_f_avg, by = \u0026#34;home_lead\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;% mutate(fenwick_adj = avg / fenwick) # Reshape to get the numbers in a more readable format score_adj_f_reshape \u0026lt;- score_adj_f %\u0026gt;% select(-c(avg, fenwick)) %\u0026gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = home_away, values_from = fenwick_adj) %\u0026gt;% select(home_lead, home, away)  This is what the score_adj_f data frame looks like before we reshape it for easier analysis. fenwick has the raw values, avg has the average values, and fenwick_adj has the weights (found by dividing avg by fenwick).\n   And this is what it looks like after.\n   Compare to 5v5 weights Now that we have our weights (shown above), we can compare to Micah's established weights for 5v5 events.\n# Read in Micah\u0026#39;s 5v5 values # And join to compare score_adj_5v5 \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026#34;score_adj_5v5_MBM.csv\u0026#34;) score_adj_f_reshape_compare \u0026lt;- score_adj_f_reshape %\u0026gt;% left_join(score_adj_5v5, by = \u0026#34;home_lead\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;% mutate(diff_home = home - home_5v5, diff_away = away - away_5v5) # Create simple bar graphs to compare ggplot(data = score_adj_f_reshape_compare, aes(x = as.factor(home_lead), y = diff_home)) + geom_bar(stat = \u0026#34;identity\u0026#34;) + labs(title = \u0026#34;Home Event Weights, 5v4 vs 5v5\u0026#34;, x = \u0026#34;Home Lead\u0026#34;, y = \u0026#34;Difference From 5v5 Weight\u0026#34;) + theme_linedraw() + theme(axis.ticks = element_blank()) ggplot(data = score_adj_f_reshape_compare, aes(x = as.factor(home_lead), y = diff_away)) + geom_bar(stat = \u0026#34;identity\u0026#34;) + labs(title = \u0026#34;Away Event Weights, 5v4 vs 5v5\u0026#34;, x = \u0026#34;Home Lead\u0026#34;, y = \u0026#34;Difference From 5v5 Weight\u0026#34;) + theme_linedraw() + theme(axis.ticks = element_blank()) for_comparison \u0026lt;- score_adj_f_reshape_compare %\u0026gt;% select(-c(diff_home:diff_away)) %\u0026gt;% rename(home_5v4 = home, away_5v4 = away) %\u0026gt;% pivot_longer(home_5v4:away_5v5, names_to = \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;, values_to = \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;% mutate(home_away = substr(type, 1, 4), state = substr(type, 6, 8)) for_comparison %\u0026gt;% filter(home_away == \u0026#34;home\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(fill = state, x = as.character(home_lead), y = value)) + geom_bar(stat = \u0026#34;identity\u0026#34;, position = \u0026#34;dodge\u0026#34;) + labs(title = \u0026#34;Home Event Weights, 5v4 vs 5v5\u0026#34;, x = \u0026#34;Home Lead\u0026#34;, y = \u0026#34;Weight\u0026#34;, fill = \u0026#34;State?\u0026#34;) + theme_linedraw() + theme(axis.ticks = element_blank()) + geom_hline(yintercept = 1) + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\u0026#34;#CF8BA8\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;#DDDDDD\u0026#34;)) for_comparison %\u0026gt;% filter(home_away == \u0026#34;away\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(fill = state, x = as.character(home_lead), y = value)) + geom_bar(stat = \u0026#34;identity\u0026#34;, position = \u0026#34;dodge\u0026#34;) + labs(title = \u0026#34;Away Event Weights, 5v4 vs 5v5\u0026#34;, x = \u0026#34;Home Lead\u0026#34;, y = \u0026#34;Weight\u0026#34;, fill = \u0026#34;State?\u0026#34;) + theme_linedraw() + theme(axis.ticks = element_blank()) + geom_hline(yintercept = 1) + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\u0026#34;#CF8BA8\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;#DDDDDD\u0026#34;))              We can see from these comparisons that overall, the magnitude of these 5v4 weights is not too different from those at 5v5. The largest difference is when the home team is trailing by one: the 5v5 weight for the away team is 1.103. At 5v4, the weight for the away team is 1.221. (Interestingly, when the home team is leading by one, the weights are nearly identical.) This difference fits the overall pattern that you can see in the graphs: the weights for the away team at 5v4 are consistently higher than they are at 5v5, regardless of the score state, and vice versa for the home team. This could suggest that events for the home team are slightly easier to generate at 5v4, regardless of score state, and therefore the away team gets more \u0026quot;credit\u0026quot; (i.e., a higher weight) for their events.\nOur last step, before we can test the repeatability and prediction of the weights, is to join these adjusted values back into the raw event data so we can use them for comparison.\n# Join the adjusted values back into the raw data score_adj_5v4_w_values \u0026lt;- score_adj_5v4 %\u0026gt;% left_join(select(score_adj_f, home_lead, home_away, fenwick_adj, f), by = c(\u0026#34;home_lead\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;home_away\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;f\u0026#34;)) Testing repeatability and prediction To examine these adjusted values in comparison to the raw ones, we'll look at both repeatability and prediction. Repeatability is measured by how well the unblocked shot attempts in one sample of a season correlate to those in another sample, and prediction looks at how well the unblocked shot attempts in one sample correlate to goals in another. Our metric of interest in both cases will be R2, and we're curious to see whether those R2 values are higher for the adjusted values.\nThe first step is to create the data set, sampling_team, that we'll use for sampling purposes. (Again, we'll filter out the lockout-shortened season.) We'll group by game_id as well as PP_team and summarize the raw fenwick values, adjusted fenwick values, goals, and total TOI. We'll also create a unique identifier of team_season that will be important for sampling purposes.\n# Testing repeatability and prediction---- # We\u0026#39;ll test repeatability of the adjusted values, compared to the raw ones # But we\u0026#39;ll be removing the shortened season # Group by game, season, and team; sum values sampling_team \u0026lt;- score_adj_5v4_w_values %\u0026gt;% select(game_id, season, PP_team, PP_fenwick, fenwick_adj, event_length, goal) %\u0026gt;% filter(season != 20122013) %\u0026gt;% group_by(season, game_id, PP_team) %\u0026gt;% summarize(fenwick = sum(PP_fenwick, na.rm = TRUE), fen_adj = sum(fenwick_adj, na.rm = TRUE), goals = sum(goal), TOI = sum(event_length) / 60) %\u0026gt;% unite(team_season, season, PP_team, sep = \u0026#34;-\u0026#34;, remove = FALSE) That sampling_team data frame will be the starting point for the sampling function I wrote that's based on the rep_sample_n function in the infer package. In a nutshell, the function below will do the following: filter the sampling_team data frame to a specific team_season; take a sample of x number of games; split that sample into two groups; sum the unblocked shot attempts (both raw and adjusted), goals, and TOI in each group; and repeat 1000 times. The pivot_wider function at the end will just reshape the data into a format that's easier to use later.\n# The function below will filter by teamseason, sample a specified amount of games,  # split into two groups, sum fenwick and fen_adj, repeat 1000 times per season sampling_fn \u0026lt;- function(value, samplesize) { sampling_team_done \u0026lt;- sampling_team %\u0026gt;% filter(team_season == value) %\u0026gt;% rep_sample_n(size = samplesize, replace = FALSE, reps = 1000) %\u0026gt;% group_by(replicate, team_season) %\u0026gt;% mutate(game_no = row_number()) %\u0026gt;% mutate(group = game_no %% 2) %\u0026gt;% mutate(samplesize = samplesize) %\u0026gt;% group_by(replicate, group, team_season, samplesize) %\u0026gt;% summarize(fenwick = sum(fenwick, na.rm = TRUE), fen_adj = sum(fen_adj, na.rm = TRUE), TOI = sum(TOI), goals = sum(goals)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(f_60 = fenwick * 60 / TOI, f_adj_60 = fen_adj * 60 / TOI, goal_60 = goals * 60 / TOI) %\u0026gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = group, values_from = c(fenwick, fen_adj, TOI, f_60, f_adj_60, goals, goal_60)) } Once the function is written, we need to apply it! You can see that our sampling_fn function requires two arguments to be supplied: value and samplesize. The value is each individual team season, since we want the function to run over each one separately. And I was curious to see how the results vary by the sample size chosen, so the code below will run separately for sample sizes of 40, 50, 60, and 70 games. Micah's 5v5 method was tested with sample sizes of 40 games, but since 5v4 time is comparatively much more rare, I wanted to test larger sample sizes as well. (This is why we eliminated the lockout-shortened season, which only had 48 games.)\nlapply is a very useful function that will perform the sampling_fn, with the selected samplesize, over each unique value of team_season from the sampling_team data frame. And the bind_rows function will collect all of the function results into one data frame.\n# Run the function for the various sample sizes summary_team \u0026lt;- lapply(unique(sampling_team$team_season), sampling_fn, samplesize = 40) sampling_team_40 \u0026lt;- bind_rows(summary_team, .id = \u0026#34;column_label\u0026#34;) summary_team \u0026lt;- lapply(unique(sampling_team$team_season), sampling_fn, samplesize = 50) sampling_team_50 \u0026lt;- bind_rows(summary_team, .id = \u0026#34;column_label\u0026#34;) summary_team \u0026lt;- lapply(unique(sampling_team$team_season), sampling_fn, samplesize = 60) sampling_team_60 \u0026lt;- bind_rows(summary_team, .id = \u0026#34;column_label\u0026#34;) summary_team \u0026lt;- lapply(unique(sampling_team$team_season), sampling_fn, samplesize = 70) sampling_team_70 \u0026lt;- bind_rows(summary_team, .id = \u0026#34;column_label\u0026#34;) I will end up with four data frames, sampling_team_40 through sampling_team_70 that are all the same size. Here is a sample:\n   replicate indicates which sample it is (each individual team_season has 1000) and the _0 and _1 appended to each metric show the two separate groups. For example, the first row here is one sample of 40 games from the Bruins' 2009-10 season. Those 40 games were divided into two groups: the first group had 111 total unblocked shot attempts, and the second group had 132. Having the data structured this way will allow us to easily calculate the correlations.\nWe'll create another function to do so, called correlations, and use the lapply function again to apply that function over our four data frames.\ncorrelations \u0026lt;- function(df) { correlation \u0026lt;- df %\u0026gt;% group_by(samplesize) %\u0026gt;% summarize(raw_f = cor(fenwick_0, fenwick_1) ^ 2, adj_f = cor(fen_adj_0, fen_adj_1) ^ 2, raw_rate = cor(f_60_0, f_60_1) ^ 2, adj_rate = cor(f_adj_60_0, f_adj_60_1) ^ 2, raw_f_pred = cor(fenwick_0, goals_1) ^ 2, adj_f_pred = cor(fen_adj_0, goals_1) ^ 2, raw_rate_pred = cor(f_60_0, goal_60_1) ^ 2, adj_rate_pred = cor(f_adj_60_0, goal_60_1) ^ 2) } cor_all \u0026lt;- lapply(list(sampling_team_40, sampling_team_50, sampling_team_60, sampling_team_70), correlations) cor \u0026lt;- bind_rows(cor_all) That will result in a very simple data frame that looks like this:\n   And we can reshape that data to more easily create some graphs.\n# Create graphs to compare---- # Reshape data to make it easier cor_reshape \u0026lt;- cor %\u0026gt;% pivot_longer(raw_f:adj_rate_pred, names_to = \u0026#34;metric\u0026#34;, values_to = \u0026#34;R2\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;% mutate(type = substr(metric, 1, 3)) %\u0026gt;% arrange(type) %\u0026gt;% mutate(type = factor(type, levels=c(\u0026#34;raw\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;adj\u0026#34;))) cor_reshape %\u0026gt;% filter(metric %in% c(\u0026#34;raw_f\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;adj_f\u0026#34;)) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(fill = type, x = samplesize, y = R2)) + geom_bar(stat = \u0026#34;identity\u0026#34;, position = \u0026#34;dodge\u0026#34;) + labs(title = \u0026#34;Repeatability: Unblocked Shot Attempts\u0026#34;, x = \u0026#34;Sample Size\u0026#34;, y = \u0026#34;R-Squared\u0026#34;, fill = \u0026#34;Adjusted?\u0026#34;) + theme_linedraw() + theme(axis.ticks = element_blank()) + geom_text(aes(label = round(R2, 3)), position = position_dodge(10), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\u0026#34;#DDDDDD\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;#CF8BA8\u0026#34;)) cor_reshape %\u0026gt;% filter(metric %in% c(\u0026#34;raw_rate\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;adj_rate\u0026#34;)) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(fill = type, x = samplesize, y = R2)) + geom_bar(stat = \u0026#34;identity\u0026#34;, position = \u0026#34;dodge\u0026#34;) + labs(title = \u0026#34;Repeatability: Unblocked Shot Attempt Rate\u0026#34;, x = \u0026#34;Sample Size\u0026#34;, y = \u0026#34;R-Squared\u0026#34;, fill = \u0026#34;Adjusted?\u0026#34;) + theme_linedraw() + theme(axis.ticks = element_blank()) + geom_text(aes(label = round(R2, 3)), position = position_dodge(10), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\u0026#34;#DDDDDD\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;#CF8BA8\u0026#34;)) cor_reshape %\u0026gt;% filter(metric %in% c(\u0026#34;raw_rate_pred\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;adj_rate_pred\u0026#34;)) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(fill = type, x = samplesize, y = R2)) + geom_bar(stat = \u0026#34;identity\u0026#34;, position = \u0026#34;dodge\u0026#34;) + labs(title = \u0026#34;Predictivity: Unblocked Shot Attempt Rate\u0026#34;, x = \u0026#34;Sample Size\u0026#34;, y = \u0026#34;R-Squared\u0026#34;, fill = \u0026#34;Adjusted?\u0026#34;) + theme_linedraw() + theme(axis.ticks = element_blank()) + geom_text(aes(label = round(R2, 3)), position = position_dodge(10), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\u0026#34;#DDDDDD\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;#CF8BA8\u0026#34;)) The two figures below show the R2 values for raw and adjusted values, by sample size, for the unblocked shot attempts and the unblocked shot attempt rate, respectively. As expected, the correlation increases along with the sample size. And although none of the R2 values are particularly large, they are consistently higher for the adjusted values. (As a comparison, Micah found a R2 value of 0.530 for a similar test with 5v5 adjusted values.)\n      Also as expected, the R2 value is much smaller when we look at prediction: how the unblocked shot attempt rate in one group predicts the goal rate in another group. Again as comparison: Micah used goal percentage instead for his prediction test and found a R2 value of 0.113.\n   My personal conclusion is that there appears to be some value from adjusting for score effects at 5v4, but I'm not sure it's enough to recommend score adjustment as common practice. For context, I'd also like to explore further into how score effects might affect the rate of drawing or taking penalties.\n","date":1579046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579046400,"objectID":"0ed8ca98ebb3b775ed3636b7c4c0da16","permalink":"/post/score-effects/","publishdate":"2020-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/score-effects/","section":"post","summary":"Score effects in hockey are well-known, whether you're watching the game or looking at numbers: teams that are losing tend to generate a greater share of the shot attempts.
