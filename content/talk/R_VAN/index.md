abstract: Canada's favorite sport isn't just fun to play and fun to watch, it's also a fun tool for learning and using R. I originally taught myself R in order to better analyze hockey, and in this workshop we'll discuss how R sparked my career path as a data analyst as well as work through beginner and intermediate data manipulation techniques from the tidyverse by calculating some box score hockey stats.
