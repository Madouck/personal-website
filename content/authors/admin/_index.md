I am a data manager in higher ed as well as a data scientist at [Zelus Analytics](https://zelusanalytics.com/). I regularly write and present on various aspects of hockey analysis, by contributing to [Hockey-Graphs](https://hockey-graphs.com/) and speaking at conferences like the Rochester Institute of Technology Sports Analytics Conference, the Ottawa Hockey Analytics Conference, and the Columbus Blue Jackets Hockey Analytics Conference. I also frequently deliver talks and workshops on R---for useR groups, R-Ladies groups, and conferences such as the Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Conference and Hockey (Analytics) Night in Canada. All articles and links to slides are available below. 

In summer 2021, I'm teaching the Statistical Graphs & Visualization course at Carnegie Mellon University. The public-facing course website is available [here](https://cmu-36315.netlify.app/).

**Work with me!** I've available for workshops on Tableau and R and select consulting work, as well. My email is below if you'd like to chat.
