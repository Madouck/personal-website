I am a higher ed data professional by day, a hockey analyst by night, and an enthusiastic R user and educator at all hours of the day. I regularly write and present on various aspects of hockey analysis, by contributing to [Hockey-Graphs](https://hockey-graphs.com/) and speaking at conferences like the Rochester Institute of Technology Sports Analytics Conference, the Ottawa Hockey Analytics Conference, and the Columbus Blue Jackets Hockey Analytics Conference. I also frequently deliver talks and workshops on R---for useR groups, R-Ladies groups, and conferences such as the Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Conference and Hockey (Analytics) Night in Canada. All articles and links to slides are available below.

**Work with me!** I've available for workshops on Tableau and R and select consulting work, as well. My email is below if you'd like to chat.
